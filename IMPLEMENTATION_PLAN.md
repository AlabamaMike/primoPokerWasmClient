# Primo Poker Client Implementation Plan

## User Journey Flow

Following the natural user experience from initial visit to playing poker:

1. **Landing/Home** ‚Üí **Login** ‚Üí **Lobby** ‚Üí **Game Room** ‚Üí **Profile**

## Phase 1: Authentication Components

### 1.1 Login Component (`src/components/auth.rs`)

#### User Experience Flow:
- User visits `/login` or clicks "Login" from home page
- Sees login form with username/email and password fields
- Can toggle to "Remember Me" option
- Can navigate to registration page
- On successful login, redirects to lobby
- On error, shows validation messages

#### Implementation Requirements:

**State Management:**
```rust
pub struct LoginPageState {
    credentials: LoginCredentials,
    loading: bool,
    error_message: Option<String>,
    remember_me: bool,
    show_password: bool,
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Input validation (client-side)
- Loading states during authentication
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- "Forgot Password" link preparation
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Password visibility toggle
- Form submission on Enter key

**Integration Points:**
